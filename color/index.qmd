## Variables & Language 

A variable is a symbol/placeholder for a value that may change.
Computer variables and natural language might not be as different as you’d think.

Different words and symbols can have different meanings for different people. They may even change over time for an individual. In the same way, the value inside a variable can change.

## Munsell Color System

Another way of conceptualizing/encoding color in terms of:

* **Color/hue**
* **Value** lightness or darkness
* **Chroma** saturation intensity

Find an interactive Munsell palette [here](https://pteromys.melonisland.net/munsell/)

## Hexadecimal Color Encoding

Hexadecimal is another way of encoding RGB colors, and p5 can understand it.

* You can learn more about hexadecimal at [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors_hex.asp)
* [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) allows you to explore color palettes and encode them in different formats.
