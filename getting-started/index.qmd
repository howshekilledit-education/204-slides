## Entrance Ticket

Look through your classmates' links in *Forum Response 1 | Shapes and Colors* in UR Courses. If you notice anything that stands out to you, reply with a comment! **Make sure you reply to at least on post.** 

<br>
OPTIONAL: See if you can figure out which code created the effect you noticed, and include that code in your post. 

# The Syllabus, Highlights

# You can have a one-week extension on ONE of your first two projects. Otherwise, late work is not accepted. 

# If I grade too high, everyone might have their grade reduced. 

# You should not come to class if you are sick. You should always come to class if you are well and able. 


## How to Complete Quiz

::: {.column width="30%"}

:::

::: {.column width="70%"}

* Only use the left column
* Write your first and last name
* Fill in the correct bubble completely!

:::

You can reference the syllabus on UR Courses, or I have a few paper copies.
This is the **last** quiz where you can reference outside materials. 

## p5.js setup() & draw()

```{javascript}
// <-- Variables you might access throughout your project goe on top. 
// Everything else should go {INSIDE A FUNCTION}

function setup(){

    // <-- Instructions in here execute AT THE START

}

function draw(){

    // <-- Instructions in here execute next, 
    // either over and over on a loop (default), 
    // or just once (if noLoop() is called)

}
```

## () {} []

Parentheses ()

Curly braces {}

Square brackets []

^These always come in pairs! Often, they hold important information. If no information is needed, they are empty, but it's still important to include both the open and closing symbols. 

Curly braces usually hold instructions for functions, loops, conditional statements etc. 
These instructions always go AFTER the opening brace { and BEFORE the closing brace }.
