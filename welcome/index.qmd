# Icebreaker Activity

Complete the **Icebreaker: Summer Media** activity in UR Courses. 

We will go around an introduce ourselves, and share our chosen pieces of media. See if you can explain WHY your choice has stuck with you.

## Introductions

Let's go around and introduce ourselves.

* Your name
* Your pronouns (if you want)
* Talk a little bit about why you chose your piece of media
* Your name again

## Cartesian Coordinates

Most graphical software uses Cartesian coordinates to define locations on the screen.

```{=latex}
\begin{tikzpicture}
% Draw grid
\draw[step=1cm,gray,very thin] (-4,-3) grid (4,3);

% Draw axes
\draw[thick,->] (-4,0) -- (4.5,0) node[anchor=north west] {$x$};
\draw[thick,->] (0,-3) -- (0,3.5) node[anchor=south east] {$y$};

% Label origin
\node[anchor=north east] at (0,0) {$O$};

% Add tick marks and labels
\foreach \x in {-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4}
    \draw (\x cm,1pt) -- (\x cm,-1pt) node[anchor=north] {$\x$};
\foreach \y in {-3,-2,-1,1,2,3}
    \draw (1pt,\y cm) -- (-1pt,\y cm) node[anchor=east] {$\y$};
\end{tikzpicture}
```
