# The quiz will start at 10:05! You may study until then. 


## How to Complete Quiz {.smaller}

::: {.column width="30%"}

:::

::: {.column width="70%"}

* Don't lift your bubble sheet from the quiz until professor says "begin"!
* If your computer is on, put it to sleep by clicking the apple in the top left, then "Sleep"
* Write your first and last name
* Write today's date, Sept. 25
* Use black/blue pen or pencil
* Only use the left column
* Fill in the correct bubble completely
* You have twenty minutes.

## A reminder about project grades

* If average grade is too high, everyone might have their grade reduced. 
* The average grade should be around 70% to avoid a downward curve. Please adjust your grade expecations accordingly. 
* In art, 100% is virtually impossible.
* 70% is a solid respectable grade. 

# Boolean Variables

## What are Boolean Variables?

Boolean variables can only hold two values:

- `true`
- `false`

They're perfect for tracking states like on/off, pressed/not pressed, or visible/hidden.

## Built-in Boolean: mouseIsPressed

P5.js provides `mouseIsPressed` - a boolean that tracks if the mouse is currently being held down.

``` {.javascript code-line-numbers="false"}
function draw() {
  if (mouseIsPressed) {
    background(255, 0, 0); // red when pressed
  } else {
    background(0, 0, 255); // blue when not pressed
  }
}
```

## Creating Your Own Boolean Variables

You can create your own boolean variables to track any state:

``` {.javascript code-line-numbers="false"}
let buttonPressed = false;
let lightOn = true;
let gameOver = false;
```

## Toggling Boolean States

Use `mousePressed()` to toggle your boolean variable:

``` {.javascript code-line-numbers="false"}
function mousePressed() {
  // Toggle the boolean value
  buttonPressed = !buttonPressed;
}
```

The `!` operator flips the boolean value:
- `!true` becomes `false`
- `!false` becomes `true`

## Boolean Logic in Conditionals

Booleans work perfectly with `if` statements:

``` {.javascript code-line-numbers="false"}
if (gameStarted) {
  // run game code
}

if (!gameOver) {  // if NOT game over
  // continue playing
}

if (playerAlive && hasAmmo) {  // AND logic
  // player can shoot
}
```


# Study for Quiz #5 on Thursday! <!--TODO-->

There is a study guide in URCourses. Be sure to bring a pen or pencil!


## What's on the Quiz vs. Live Demos

Slides and Coding Train tutorials will include the material you need to know for the next quiz.

Demos will cover quiz material and may preview more advanced material.


# In confusion lies the seeds to understanding!
